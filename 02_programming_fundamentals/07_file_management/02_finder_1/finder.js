/*
Your Finder is a little bit cheap, let's add some killer-features !

If you select a directory (except for ../):

A menu will display the following options:

    Open : to open the directory;
    Copy : to open a new prompt and to perform a copy of the directory into another directory;
    Move : to open a new prompt and to move the directory into another directory;

If you select a file:

    A menu will display the following options:

        Open : Read and display the content of the file;
        Copy : to open a new prompt and to perform a copy of the file into another place;
        Move : to open a new prompt and to move the file into another file;

    Navigating through our files has never been so enjoyable!
